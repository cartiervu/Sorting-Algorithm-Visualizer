Visually animates well known sorting algorithms.

## Bubble Sort
Bubble sort, sometimes referred to as sinking sort, is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.

## Selection Sort
Selection sort sorts an array by repeatedly finding the minimum element (considering ascending order) from unsorted part and putting it at the beginning.

## Insertion Sort
Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works similar to the way you sort playing cards in your hands. The array is virtually split into a sorted and an unsorted part. Values from the unsorted part are picked and placed at the correct position in the sorted part.
